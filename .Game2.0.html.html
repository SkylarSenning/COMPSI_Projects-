		<textarea class="displayed" id="myarea">You were on vacation in the South Pacific when your small cruise ship developed a mechanical failure with the water intake and sunk! Only a few people survived along with your self. After floating in a life raft for two days you washed ashore on a deserted island. All you have in the life raft is a compass, and the time has come to find food and water. 	Decide whether you want to travel North, South East or West. Choose wisely because the island is uncharted, and if you get hurt no one coming to rescue you! 		--May the odds be ever in your favor! 		</textarea>
